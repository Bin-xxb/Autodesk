This directory is where you place custom pages for your community (as opposed to quilts that override default Lithium pages, such as CommunityPage.quilt.xml).

Quilts use the extension .quilt.xml
Quilts must reference a single layout (a file with the .layout.xml)
Quilts must use valid XML
This directory can contain only one subdirectory, and that directory must be named 'custom'.

See 'Customize Quilts' (http://localhost:9100/develop/customize#quilts) for the XML elements supported in quilts.
