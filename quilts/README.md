This file contains quilts that override core Lithium quilts, such as ForumTopicPage.quilt.xml. Entirely new quilts (one that does not already exist as a default Lithium page) go in `/res/quilts/custom`.

Quilts use the extension .quilt.xml
Quilts must reference a single layout (a file with the .layout.xml)
Quilts must use valid XML
This directory can contain only one subdirectory, and that directory must be named 'custom'.

See 'Customize Quilts' (http://localhost:9100/develop/customize#quilts) for the XML elements supported in quilts.
